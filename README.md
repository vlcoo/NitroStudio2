This is a **work-in-progress** attempt of making [Gota7's Nitro Studio 2](https://github.com/Gota7/NitroStudio2/) cross-platform! It's **not usable** quite yet.

## Main Goals
- Migrate to a newer .NET platform that will support more than Windows-only builds.
- Port the GUI from WinForms to [Eto](https://github.com/picoe/Eto).
- See if more stuff needs to be added.

## Dependencies
This program uses some dependencies that live in their own repos (which they've also been forked). They're included as git submodules.
