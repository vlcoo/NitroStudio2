This is a **work-in-progress** attempt of making [Gota7's Nitro Studio 2](https://github.com/Gota7/NitroStudio2/) cross-platform! It's **not usable** quite yet.

## Main Goals
- Migrate to a newer .NET platform that will support more than Windows-only builds (Linux & MacOS hopefully).
- Port the GUI from WinForms to [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).
- See if more stuff needs to be added.
- Keep it as nice, simple and light as the original project!

## Dependencies
This program uses some dependencies that live in their own repos (which they've also been forked from Gota7's repositories; they'll be migrated too for compatibility). They're included as git submodules.
